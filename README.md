# DriverPass-Project
The DriverPass System Design Project was developed to model and document a comprehensive online platform for student drivers to prepare for their licensing exams. The system integrates online practice tests, lesson scheduling, and secure payment processing within one unified environment.
DriverPass Project Summary

DriverPass was a client project for a small company aiming to help student drivers pass their license exams more effectively. The system we designed combined online practice tests, progress tracking, and in-person scheduling for driving lessons. It needed to serve three user types — students, instructors, and administrators — and provide secure logins, scheduling, and payment processing in one platform.

What I Did Well

I created detailed UML diagrams that correctly modeled the system’s functionality, including use case and activity diagrams that clearly showed relationships between users, data, and system operations. I also focused on maintaining clear requirements traceability between user stories and design artifacts.

What I Would Revise

After many revisions, I would change the wording and maybe some of the organization in order to make it more user understandable, as some of the charts are a mess in my opinion, in the past submissions I had made the UML case, sequence, and class diagrams incorrectly so those main points were recently changed.

Interpreting User Needs

I interpreted the user’s needs by analyzing DriverPass’s goals: students needed convenience, instructors needed scheduling visibility, and admins needed reporting and control. Translating those needs into modular UML designs helped ensure the system reflected how each user would interact with it. Considering the user’s needs is critical because software that doesn’t align with user goals will fail, no matter how well it’s built technically.

Approach to Designing Software

When designing software, I start with requirements gathering, then move into modeling and prototyping using UML diagrams to visualize relationships early. I rely on iterative refinement — improving the design after peer or instructor feedback. Going forward, I’ll continue using UML tools like LucidChart and agile modeling techniques to plan scalable, user-centered systems efficiently.
